     * calls – calculated through (2^n) + (2^n) - 1, which is asymptotically equivalent to O(2^n).
     *
     * The space complexity is O(n). This space will be used to store the recursion stack. Since the recursive algorithm
     * works in a depth-first fashion, which means that we can’t have more than ‘n’ recursive calls on the call stack at
     * any time.
